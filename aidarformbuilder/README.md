## Aidar Connect Form Builder
### Front End UI
In this project, we are using React.js for building the front-end user interface of the AidarConnect form builder.

#### Prerequisites
Before starting, ensure that the following are installed on your system:

1. **Node.js**: Download and install the [latest stable version of Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) from the official website. Node.js comes with **npm** (Node Package Manager) which is required to install project dependencies.
2. **React.js**: React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It will be automatically installed when setting up the project dependencies through npm.
